## Describe a computation from your experience or research that could use HPC resources

1. Describe that data that you would use or generate  
2. Sketch the serial methodology that would be applied.  
3. Would this computation take a long time or a lot of memory? Even if it does not, it can be worthwhile to speed it up for experimentation.

You can write the description in English or Czech. Work in your groups and send me a description when you are ready.

During the next lectures, your group can take a few minutes to present this to the class via zoom. The class can discuss some ways to sketch this computation on a cluster. 

I am hoping to get one or two such discussions each week. We may need to work out the logistics for in-classroom presentations.
