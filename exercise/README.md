cop package installation:

It will not install with remotes::install_github("RBigData/cop").

It is best to clone it to your directory with
`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/RBigData/cop.git`
and install outside R with
`R CMD INSTALL cop`
when you are in the directory where `cop` appears.
